# The Tiny Bug Hunt: Turn-Based Roguelike

This game is turn-based in the sense of a game like Brogue or Rogue or any of that lineage.
TODO: Which means you should probably play Brogue.

**Concept:** You are a programmer trapped inside a corrupted computer system. Your goal is to navigate the labyrinthine code, fix bugs (enemies), and reach the core of Yendor.

**Features:**

* **Turn-based combat:** Fight bugs with simple attacks and logic-based "spells" (like deleting code lines). 
* **Procedural levels:** Each level is a randomly generated section of code with rooms (functions), corridors (variables), and enemies (bugs). 
* **Simple inventory:** Collect power-ups like new logic commands to enhance your spells.
* **Permadeath:**  If you die, you restart from the beginning.

**Additional ideas to consider (optional):**

* Different bug types with unique weaknesses to specific logic commands.
* Shops in "safe haven" areas to buy temporary buffs.
* Mini-games to learn new logic commands.

**Benefits of this challenge:**

* Simple ASCII graphics makes development faster.
* Focuses on core roguelike mechanics: exploration, combat, and permadeath.
* Allows for creative enemy design based on bugs and code manipulation.
