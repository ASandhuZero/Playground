1. Generate level
2. Generate mappings
- We can give it an arbitrary tilemap and then from that tilemap to generating rulesets 
so with this tool we can give it a bunch of tilemaps and size of tiles and it will generate out the rulesets to tweak and what else you need.

It should give out tilemaps and constraints

there is an interesting piece of research where using convolutions to do next to next neighbor pair, and we can speculate paper. 

The question is it possible to go from the pixel space of learning and to the tile space of learning and keeps the ruleset/orientations and use that output to generate new tilemaps through the rule version

Why would you want to do this?
- Bringing the novice designers and wavefunctioncollapse and combining it together to make a fully automated generative process.

This is a tool to help novice designers to generate out tilemaps, just like how we have tools to help novice writers generate stories.

Like that level that's been generated? Put it back into the training set

Randomizers and those who make levels
